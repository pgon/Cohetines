Cohetines!

Yet another Commodore 64 game developed in 2022.

The main idea is to explore the possibilities programming the C64 in assembler and also explore the possibilities for game development.

The project was created in CBM prg Studio to simplify the editing of sprites and screens in multicolor text mode. GangEd was used for the image in bitmap mode.

Assembly code is fully commented.
